# Dirichlet Mixture Model for Probabilistic Reversal Learning
## Description (TODO)
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Requirements (TODO)
Make and Julia -> More detailed

## Setting up the project
To setup the required directories run the following command in the commandline
```
make init
```
Afterwards, start the Julia REPL and run the following command to go into pkg mode
```
]
```
followed by
```
activate .
```
to activate the Julia envrionment.

## Usage (TODO)
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Visuals (TODO)
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
